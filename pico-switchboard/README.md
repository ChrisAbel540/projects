# pico-switchboard

This project brings back to life a slider panel consisting of two sections of 10 sliders, each with 10 settable positions (image to follow). For now I'll just concentrate on reinstating just the one section, as I'll ned to use a different scheme to read both sections with a single Pi Pico.
I use a [Keypad Scan theme](http://esd.cs.ucr.edu/labs/decode_key/decode_key.html), to iteratively poll each row by each column, and arrange this into a binary array.

This panel was recovered from the scrap bin at [Norwich Hackspace](https://norwichhackspace.org/) and a long internet search yields no information about where it was taken from, or it's initial use.
